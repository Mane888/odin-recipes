    <h2>Carrot Bread</h2>
    <p>This carrot bread is really a cross between cake and a loaf of bread. Serving it warm with butter or cream cheese is ideal. It's really good!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package flaked coconut</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup maraschino cherries, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Combine eggs, oil, and milk; stir into flour mixture until well blended. Stir in carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins, and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before removing from the pan to cool completely. Store in plastic wrap to keep moist.</li>
        </ol>
